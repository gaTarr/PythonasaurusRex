The purpose of this program is to accept any input,
convert to an integer type, and output the integer.
"""

print(int(9))
print(int(14.7))
print(int('35'))

#First, an int is cast to an int, so output is the same is the input

#Second, in casting to an int, the remainder is discarded, and an int is returned

#Third, the string is cast to in int
